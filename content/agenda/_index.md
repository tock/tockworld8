## Contributors Day (June 26, 2024) {#day1}

The first day is intended for current _and future_ contributors to the Tock
project to have in-depth discussions focused on the development of the Tock
kernel, the Tock application runtime, and other projects in the Tock ecosystem.
This will feature talks about new experimental Tock features, discussions on
future Tock designs, and work on prototyping new features.

The discussions will be highly technical and Tock-specific. If that resonates
with you, please plan to attend!

<small>_If you would like to add something to contributors day, please reach
out to the TW7 organizers (Pat, Brad, & Amit)._</small>
