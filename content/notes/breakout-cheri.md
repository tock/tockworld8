Lawrence Esswood -> CHERI, CHERIOS at Cambridge
Kevin Lee -> Microsoft

Overview:
* RISC-V Cheri seems to be the future

Prototyping tock:
* QEMU is the best option
* QEMU has support for this
* rustc-cheri is really annoying and you need an LLVM with a CHERI backend
  * Open source version is good enough
  * LLVM is good enough, clang is good enough
  * rustc is not there yet
* Rustc compiler support for capability
* Mapping of LLVM-intrinsics to libcore would be useful
* Most of the problems are toolchain issue
* TockOS as a client for pointer provenance

* TockOS needs general refactoring -> to refactor to strict provenance
* Does not compile with strict_provenance
* The number of capabilities added to Tock is minimal, there could be more added
* TockOS CHERI patches is currently using _hybrid_ CHERI (mixing cap pointers and non-cap pointers)
* How about adding a libcheri to rustc library set?
  * New assembly constraints for capability registers
* Can you ban raw pointers without capabilities?
  * Clippy?
* Open questions
  * What is purecap Rust?


Takeaway:
* Thereâ€™s some keenness for RISC-V changes from another team
* The rustc support is the big blocker
* TockOS can be the lead user for the RISC-V
* Early started project to RISC-V
