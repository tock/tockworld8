Do you have a unique perspective to share on Tock OS or secure
embedded systems with an engaged audience at TockWorld 8! We encourage
you to submit a talk through our [CFP
(call-for-proposals)](https://sessionize.com/tockworld-8)!

Talks can be either 30min or 60min. Both include the time for
Q&A. Event fees, travel, and accomodation expenses are covered for
speakers.

We welcome submissions on any topic of interest to the Tock developer
and user community, and we specifically encourages submissions on the
following topics:

* Tock in New and Exciting Places: Are you using Tock in an interesting or unique setting? This category is for you. If you're using Tock for a reason/industry different to most of the audience, we'd love to hear from you!

* Technical Deep Dives: Give us a guided tour through the technical nitty-gritty of something you’ve built! Dive into the code and enlighten us on what can be learned from your work.

* Reflections: Have an interesting or unique story about a challenge you faced using or developing Tock? Talks in this category will feature reflections about the experience of using and working with Tock – good, bad, and/or ugly.

* Real World Tock: Insights and stories from deploying Tock in a corporate, industrial, or government setting. Share how you made the case to use Tock for your project, how it was sold to you, and how those promises have panned out!

* Embedded Experiences: Do you have an interesting or unique experience to share on building or deploying Rust in low-level or embedded settings? If you are using Rust "close-to-the-metal" or in other embedded contexts we want to hear your story.
    Other: Define your own category!
