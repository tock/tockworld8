## Getting to San Diego

### By Air

[San Diego International Airport (SAN)](https://www.san.org/) is roughly ten
miles south of campus and has flights with all major airlines.

Upon arrival, beyond ride-share and rental car options, your host is a
public transit enthusiast and would encourage you to consider taking
[the shuttle between the airport and downtown SD](https://www.sdmts.com/getting-around/departures-and-schedules/schedules/992)
or
[the shuttle to the light rail transit hub](https://www.san.org/to-from/Public-Transportation#1178347-san-diego-flyer), depending on your final destination.

If public transit doesn't make sense for your travel, you are also encouraged
to try the [Ride United App](https://utwsd.org/ride-united-app/), which is an
alternative to traditional ride-sharing apps developed and maintained by the
local taxi workers (in partnership with [researchers at UCSD](https://www.udayan.info/))
where drivers receive a larger portion of your fare (which is often also lower
than fares in other apps).


#### Other Airport Options

[Tijuana International Airport (TIJ)](https://www.airport-tijuana.com/) is roughly thirty-five miles south of campus, located on the US/Mexico border.
There is a pedestrian bridge directly from the TIJ international terminal to the United States, i.e., you do not have to clear Mexican customs to travel through TIJ.
**In addition to your flight,** you will need to buy **round trip** tickets for the [Cross Border Exchange (CBX)](https://www.crossborderxpress.com/).
For international travellers (especially from Central and South America) it can often be (much) cheaper to fly through TIJ.


[Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)](https://www.flylax.com/) is a little
over 2 hours north of campus (_without_ factoring in traffic). There are direct
flights to most major cities through LAX, but it can be a bit annoying to get
down to San Diego. Renting cars at LAX is worse than the average airport car
rental experience.
You can take [the FlyAway Bus](https://www.flylax.com/en/flyaway-bus#Routes)
from LAX airport to LAX Union Station and follow the train directions below.
It's a roughly 30 minute trip from LAX to LAX (yes, they are the same name;
yes, this is confusing; no, they are not close).


[John Wayne Airport, Orange County / Santa Ana Airport (SNA)](https://www.ocair.com/)
is a smaller regional airport a little over an hour north of campus. It
sometimes has surprisingly cheap fares for odd routes, and also serves some
of the more interesting non-traditional carriers like
[Jet Suite X](https://flights.jsx.com/en/flights-from-orange-county) if that's
your vibe. Transit connections are pretty awful, though the SNA Amtrak (train)
station is a twenty-ish minute cab ride away.


### By Train

If you're in the greater southern California area,
especially along the [LOSSAN Corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Surfliner#LOSSAN_Rail_Corridor_Agency),
Amtrak is a great option. The Pacific Surfliner is the second-busiest route in
Amtrak's network and trains run roughly hourly in both directions most of the
day. It's also a [famously beautiful route](https://news.pacificsurfliner.com/pacificsurfliner-exterior),
as the line runs right along the coast for most of the trip â€“Â sit on the west
side of the train to enjoy the views (especially sunset if you can time it).


### By Bike

San Diego is a mixture of great and terrible biking infrastructure. For more
experienced bike commuters, staying somewhere like
[Pacific Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/k3TGURSw1FbXvW8DA)
is mostly a lovely ride on separate river/rail trail. The last mile and a
half or so, however, is a
[Class II](https://www.sandiego.gov/bicycling/lanes-and-routes) lane on the
side of a faster road. Nonetheless, there are many bike rental options around
(including many e-bike options), which can be a nice, different way to
experience a city.


### By Car

Campus is off Interstate 5 (I-5).
[Hopkins Parking Structure](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JGKhQt9FbJh1286q7) is the
closest / easiest structure with ample
[visitor parking ($4.20/hr; $34/day)](https://transportation.ucsd.edu/visit/visitor/index.html).
Your transit-enthusiast host will note that the light rail station is closer
than the most convenient / accessible parking structure, and a day pass is only $6.



## Where to Stay

UC San Diego's campus is large, and as a consequence, a bit isolated from
anything too interesting. If you do want to stay near the venue, the three
closest hotels to campus are:
 - [Estancia La Jolla](https://www.estancialajolla.com/)
 - [Residence Inn San Diego La Jolla (Marriott)](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/lajca-residence-inn-san-diego-la-jolla/overview/)
 - [Hyatt Regency La Jolla](https://www.hyatt.com/hyatt-regency/en-US/jolla-hyatt-regency-la-jolla-at-aventine)

There are many more in the immediate area if you have a preferred chain, etc.

However, the CSE building is
[a five minute walk from the Blue Line light rail station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QewfHT9G75iCnYuBA).
Trains run from 4:30am to 12:30am, and run every 15 minutes for most of the day.
This opens up more of the city.
In rough order of suggestion, any of the Little Italy, Old Town, or Gaslamp
(basically downtown proper) neighborhoods have good Blue Line access and some
more interesting things to do / places to eat, etc in the immediate vicinity.

## Extending your trip ðŸ˜‡

San Diego is both the 8th-most populous US city, and home to some of the
([#8, #9](https://fox5sandiego.com/news/local-news/coronado-beach-makes-list-of-top-beaches-in-us/) or [#1](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/tourism/sdut-coronado-no-1-beach-in-us-2012may25-htmlstory.html) depending who you talk to) best
