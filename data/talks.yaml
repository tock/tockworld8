  abstract: |
    Scale and performance have for a long time been the dominant
    topics in software development. However, that has changed over the
    recent years. A major topic nowadays is trust.

    But how did that happen? And what does this have to do with Rust?
    And how can we engage with it?

    This talk tells of a mindshift that silently took its course, the
    reasons for it, and gives practical guidance on how to deal with
    it.

  title: Porting Tock to x86 for Pluton
  time: 10:15
  room: 1242
  abstract: |

    Pluton is a root-of-trust technology jointly developed by
    Microsoft and various SoC partners. It is essentially a
    purpose-built security processor embedded directly within the SoC
    die. The SoC partners have some flexibility in dictating how the
    Pluton core is implemented, however Microsoft owns the firmware
    and has chosen to use TockÂ OS as a common platform for (nearly)
    all Pluton firmware deliverables.

    One of our SoC partners has chosen to implement Pluton using an
    embedded-class x86 core. To support this platform, our team
    created a port of Tock OS for the x86 architecture. This allowed
    us to easily port the rest of our Pluton logic, which lives in a
    usermode app, to the new platform with virtually zero code
    changes.

    This talk dives into the technical aspects of our x86 port,
    including interrupt handling, memory management, the syscall
    interface, and emulation. We will also touch on some of the pain
    points we encountered and some

  title: Running Tock OS on WebAssembly
  time: 11:15
  room: 1242
  abstract: |

    In addition to Cortex-M and RISC-V chips, TockOS can now run on
    WebAssembly.  Developing the kernel can be done with little to no
    setup, by running and debugging the operating system in a sandbox
    on your machine.

    The chip implementation provides the low-level drivers for
    peripherals like GPIO, UART and timers, which is possible due to
    the interoperability of the WebAssembly modules.  Since hardware
    peripherals are not available, their state, which would usually be
    retrieved from memory-mapped registers, is updated through a
    WebSocket-based protocol written in TypeScript.  Running
    `libtock` applications is done by emulating the Cortex-M4
    architecture using Unicorn.js (WASM reimport of the Unicorn CPU
    Emulator written in C).  Developers can debug the WASM kernel
    through the Node.js Debugger, and the applications through a GDB
    Stub for Unicorn, written in TypeScript.

  title: Bringing Tock to CHERI
  time: 13:15
  room: 1242
  abstract: |

    CHERI is a set of ISA extensions (with implementations on RISC-V, MIPS,
    armv8, and more) that add hardware enforced capabilities. These can be
    utilised by operating systems not just to provide an alternative access
    control mechanism (instead of an MMU or MPU), but also to enforce
    system-wide safety in a way that these other mechanisms struggle to help.
    In this presentation, I will talk about my experience bringing Tock to a
    RISC-V CHERI platform. I will demonstrate how just slight modifications to
    code (and new hardware) can improve the hardness of the syscall boundary,
    and give an example of how the kernel and userspace can work together to
    provide a temporally safe C heap.

  title: Multiplexing Serial Port Messages
  time: 14:15
  room: 1242
  abstract: |

    Design, description, and implementation nuances of the new
    PacketBuffer mechanism. PacketBuffer allows the appending and
    prepending of metadata into messages sent on the serial port
    without re-allocating memory at every prepend/append.

    This talk will also introduce a new GUI app that connects to the
    board, reads from the serial port, and uses the metadata to filter
    messages by sender (the process console, debug messages, and each
    application) and to show them separately in the UI.

  title: Teaching Embedded Systems with Tock
  time: 16:10
  room: 1242
  abstract: |

    We have been teaching an embedded undergraduate course using Rust
    as the programming language. This talk wants to point out the
    strength of Tock compared to alternative Rust systems and why we
    think it might be better for education. We also propose a number
    of modifications, which we are already working on, that would make
    Tock a excellent choice for teaching embedded courses.
