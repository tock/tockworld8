- How can we encourage participation in libtock-rs?
  - not a lot of activity to review (no contributions to review)
  - writing bindings for both C and Rust is more overhead (discourages). automation would help
  - more familiar with c than rust, don't know what rust should look like
  - libtock-c and libtock-rs drivers look very different
  - automation for writing wrappers
- libtock-rs so hard to use with relocations
  - tockloader to do the relocation?
  - lack of relocations is a big barrier
  - can't run multiple applications
- relocations for llvm in arm
  - arm: "there is support for PIC in LLVM and that is good enough" (wrong PIC for Tock)
  - perhaps more pestering from more users would help
  - lowrisc is stabilizing a ePIC standard for risc-v (and maybe arm) but moving VERY slowly
  - can we use libgcc backend as an option?
- typical pattern for tock drivers: allow, allow, subscribe, command
  - could almost do that in JSON
- libtock-rs: scope issues
  - libtock-rs not compatible with futures
- libtock-rs: sync and async versions?
- libtock-rs: copy-paste for drivers
- we don't know if libtock-X drivers match the kernel
- how do we get open example applications?
  - tpm2 as an example
    - often requires special hardware
  - *** OpenSK as a better example
  - doable to get 90% of an example, last 10% kludges are harder to get upstreamed and fixed
- are outdated use cases useful?
- example: TodoMVC. general benchmark for web frameworks.
  - could example for tock be to start with a easily purchasable hardware platform and show the tock implementation
- can libtock-rs us FFI to work with something like OpenThread?
