  title: Porting Tock to x86 for Pluton
  time: 10:15
  room: 1242
  abstract: |

    Pluton is a root-of-trust technology jointly developed by
    Microsoft and various SoC partners. It is essentially a
    purpose-built security processor embedded directly within the SoC
    die. The SoC partners have some flexibility in dictating how the
    Pluton core is implemented, however Microsoft owns the firmware
    and has chosen to use TockÂ OS as a common platform for (nearly)
    all Pluton firmware deliverables.

    One of our SoC partners has chosen to implement Pluton using an
    embedded-class x86 core. To support this platform, our team
    created a port of Tock OS for the x86 architecture. This allowed
    us to easily port the rest of our Pluton logic, which lives in a
    usermode app, to the new platform with virtually zero code
    changes.

    This talk dives into the technical aspects of our x86 port,
    including interrupt handling, memory management, the syscall
    interface, and emulation. We will also touch on some of the pain
    points we encountered and some

  title: Running Tock OS on WebAssembly
  time: 11:15
  room: 1242
  abstract: |

    In addition to Cortex-M and RISC-V chips, TockOS can now run on
    WebAssembly.  Developing the kernel can be done with little to no
    setup, by running and debugging the operating system in a sandbox
    on your machine.

    The chip implementation provides the low-level drivers for
    peripherals like GPIO, UART and timers, which is possible due to
    the interoperability of the WebAssembly modules.  Since hardware
    peripherals are not available, their state, which would usually be
    retrieved from memory-mapped registers, is updated through a
    WebSocket-based protocol written in TypeScript.  Running
    `libtock` applications is done by emulating the Cortex-M4
    architecture using Unicorn.js (WASM reimport of the Unicorn CPU
    Emulator written in C).  Developers can debug the WASM kernel
    through the Node.js Debugger, and the applications through a GDB
    Stub for Unicorn, written in TypeScript.

  title: Bringing CHERI to Tock
  time: 13:15
  room: 1242
  abstract: |

    I will cover the basics of what CHERI and capabilities are. I will
    show the notable places I had to make changes to support CHERI on
    Tock; how allow_rx changes, and what the MPU implementation looks
    like. I will show how upgrading the syscall interface can help
    protect an application from itself by allowing the kernel to
    understand object boundaries. Possibly, I might also demo how
    CHERI can add temporal safety for the C heap.

  title: Multiplexing Serial Port Messages
  time: 14:15
  room: 1242
  abstract: |

    Design, description, and implementation nuances of the new
    PacketBuffer mechanism. PacketBuffer allows the appending and
    prepending of metadata into messages sent on the serial port
    without re-allocating memory at every prepend/append.

    This talk will also introduce a new GUI app that connects to the
    board, reads from the serial port, and uses the metadata to filter
    messages by sender (the process console, debug messages, and each
    application) and to show them separately in the UI.
