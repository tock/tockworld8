## Day 1 (June 26th, 2024) - Developer Day

The first day is focused on the development of the Tock kernel and other
projects in the Tock ecosystem. This will feature talks about new experimental
Tock features, discussions on future Tock designs, and work on prototyping new
features. The intended audience for this first day are developers who have
contributed (or plan to) to the Tock repository.
